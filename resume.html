    <h1>Sara Elizabeth Jensen</h1>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>I love to listen; I love to talk; I love to work.</p>
    <p>My duty in work and life is to make and take actionable steps towards overcoming obstacles to progress. I introduce agile testing concepts appropriate to my team early and often in the development process. I learn technologies to clear the way for quality work to ship.</p>
    <p>Oh, and did I mention I climb volcanoes in my spare time?</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Software QA with Idealist.org</h3>
    <p>Software Quality Assurance, to me, is about investigation, discovery, adaptation, communication and the pursuit of excellence.
    At Idealist.org, I worked for the builders products and programs that serve those who do the work of building a better world.</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>I worked as the only QA person between 3 agile development teams.</li>
        <li>With the product team, I reviewed PRDs for corner cases, as well as evaluated the form and function of the designs to eye and consult on their ease of use, technical complexity, and consistency with brand identity.</li>
        <li>With development teams, I monitored stash, determining if a commit should be seen in advance with a demo server that I had the ability to spin up myself.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Technical Support Representive</h3>
    <p>Technical support is a juggling act of compassion, diplomacy, and hard work.</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>As the Technical Support Representative at Idealist.org, my most important job was to make sure every person I talked to felt heard, supported. They knew I was working for them, and advocating on their behalf. That meant users, my fellow supporters, the development team, the product team, and stakeholders all had the information they needed to perform their job.</li>
        <li>I updated our solutions database and help pages with the clearest, friendliest, most professional language.</li>
        <li>I reported bugs in JIRA, constantly refining the best way to report to developers so they take the least amount of time to understand the issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
